- (July 22) Following the discussions with Karthik ([#8](../../discussions/8)) and Sam ([#15](../../discussions/15)), we have decided to remove all lines containing in-sentence "white space tokens" from the NER dataset. The test set has also been revised to the same format, where it will be used evaluate your submissions for Subtask-1.

# Subtasks

Baselines for each subtask are located in the following respositories

- [Subtask 1 - NER](https://github.com/nl4opt/nl4opt-subtask1-baseline)
- [Subtask 2 - generation](https://github.com/nl4opt/nl4opt-subtask2-baseline)
